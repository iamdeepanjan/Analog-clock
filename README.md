# Analog Clock

A simple analog clock built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Features

* Displays the current time
* Updates in real-time
* Uses a circular clock face with hour, minute, and second hands

## How it works

The clock uses the `setInterval` function to update the time every second. The [setTime](Analog-clock/script.js:4:0-18:1) function is called every second to update the position of the hour, minute, and second hands.

## Code Structure

The project consists of three main files:

* `index.html`: The main HTML file that contains the clock face and hands
* `style.css`: The CSS file that styles the clock face and hands
* `script.js`: The JavaScript file that updates the time and positions the hands

## Usage

 Simply open the `index.html` file in a web browser to view the clock.
